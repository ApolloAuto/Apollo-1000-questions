How to Convert a Dataset to a Record Package?
==============================

To evaluate the performance of Apollo's perception algorithms on a specific dataset, I want to convert the data in the dataset into the format required by Apollo for testing on the Apollo platform.

You can use the \ ``adataset``\ tool to convert a dataset to a record package. Currently supported datasets include: apolloscape, KITTI, and nuScenes.

Taking the nuScenes dataset as an example, set \ ``dataset_path``\ to the path where the nuScenes dataset is located. By default, the package is output to the current directory.

.. code:: shell

   adataset -d=n -i=dataset_path

For nuScenes, the record package name is scene_token.record, for KITTI it is result.record, and for ApolloScape it is frame_id.record.
